\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{JavaScript}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item General tips
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Don't mix types
   \item Use simple types as much as possible
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Use an integer as an ID instead of a string
    \item Use short arrays to store short vectors (e.g. x, y, z coordinates)
   \end{itemize}
   \item Recompute simple values, don't store them
   \item Use arrays when possible
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{JavaScript (continued)}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item DOM navigation
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Use \sourcecode{node.children} not \sourcecode{node.childNodes} to
          navigate child nodes
    \item Always iterate at the same level with \sourcecode{nextElementSibling}
   \end{itemize}
  \item Object management
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Use standard objects over classes and prototypes
   \item Don't add new properties to an object after initialization
   \item Don't remove properties with \sourcecode{delete}
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Garbage collection}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Use small types whenever possible
  \item Avoid creating too many temporary objects
  \item Don't hold objects you don't need any more
  \item Watch out for variables held by closures
  \item Again, don't add new properties to an object after initialization
  \item Again, don't remove properties with \sourcecode{delete}
  \item Unbind all unused listeners
  \item If you're keeping a cache around or a similar structure listen to
        \sourcecode{memory-pressure} events and flush it when you receive them
  \item Be careful when manipulating strings
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Avoid useless concatenations / splits
   \item Avoid concatenating to large strings
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{CSS}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Keep selectors simple
  \item Complex selectors can be expensive and make your styles hard to
        understand for people reading the code
  \item Use ID-, tag- and class-based rules
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \sourcecode{\#toppanel \{\ldots{}\}}
   \item \sourcecode{.squarebutton \{\ldots{}\}}
   \item \sourcecode{a \{\ldots{}\}}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Avoid universal selectors
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \sourcecode{[hidden=true] \{\ldots{}\}}
  \end{itemize}
  \item In general the less elements a rule can apply to the better
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Layout}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Always specify sizes for elements if possible
  \item Prefer CSS backgrounds to image tags
  \item Setting a position / size property will likely trigger a reflow, group
        those changes to multiple elements to avoid causing more than one
  \item Reading a position / size property before the page has been reflowed
        will cause a reflow and it will be a \emph{synchronous} one!
  \item Use a \sourcecode{DocumentFragment} to append elements to a DOM tree
  \item Fully initialize a new element before adding it to the DOM tree
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Painting}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Group methods that do or cause repainting
  \item Avoid animated images (PNG/GIF), are expensive to paint and inflexible
  \item Make good use of \sourcecode{<canvas>} elements
  \begin{itemize}
   \item For animation that is not possible via CSS properties
   \item For drawing small animated UI elements (e.g. status icons)
   \item For animated images
   \item They are \sourcecode{requestAnimationFrame()}-friendly
   \item Use native types in the drawing code (arrays, etc...)
   \item Do not use them for things that can be done using conventional methods,
         native Gecko is faster at drawing than JavaScript code
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Startup performance}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Don't include scripts or stylesheets that are not immediately needed, load them when needed
  \item Use the "defer" or "async" attribute on script tags needed at startup
  \item Create DOM elements only when they are actually needed
   \begin{itemize}
    \item An element can be hidden in a comment and extracted from it when needed
    \item \sourcecode{<div id="foo"><!-- <div> ... --></div>}
    \item \sourcecode{foo.innerHTML = foo.firstChild.nodeValue}
   \end{itemize}
  \item Optimize your assets
  \item Don't wait for storage / remote resources, load them while the application is already running
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Application responsiveness}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Can be hampered by a number of issues
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Blocking on slow operations (I/O, network)
   \item Long-running CPU-intensive operations
   \item Excessive updates / refreshes
   \item Platform limitations
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use asynchronous APIs as much as possible
   \begin{itemize}
    \item For storage I/O
     \begin{itemize}
      \item AsyncStorage is what you want
      \item Keep away from LocalStorage (unless it's used in a worker)
      \item Using IndexedDB directly is fine but keep everything asynchronous
     \end{itemize}
    \item For network resources
    \begin{itemize}
     \item You don't want your application to wait for a timeout to expire
    \end{itemize}
    \item For local resources too opt for asynchronous interfaces when both async and sync are available
   \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Application responsiveness (CPU usage)}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Limiting CPU usage is always a win
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Lets other applications run smoothly
  \item Makes the CPU available for background tasks
  \item Lengthens battery life!
 \end{itemize}
  \item Use web worker threads to offload CPU-intensive or long-running tasks
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \url{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers}
   \item Keeps the main thread free and thus the application responsive
   \item Limitation: a worker cannot manipulate the DOM!
  \end{itemize}
  \item Watch out for event handler spam
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Data transfer progress updates
    \item Rapidly firing timers
    \item Throttle or group events when possible
   \end{itemize}
  \item Always use requestAnimationFrame() for animations
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
